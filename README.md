# Fast-Gaussian-Elimination
A fast algorithm for Gaussain elimination over GF(2)

This project implements the algorithm described in this [paper](https://www.cs.umd.edu/%7Egasarch/TOPICS/factoring/fastgauss.pdf).

This algorithm was used in the implementation of the quadratic sieve in :

## Future Work
- Implement the algorithm in parallel architecture
- Compare results
